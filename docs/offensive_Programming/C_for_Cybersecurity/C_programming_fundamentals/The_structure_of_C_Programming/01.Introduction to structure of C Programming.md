title: Introduction to structure of C program
---

The C programming structure follows a well-structured manner, much like a recipe for cooking a meal.
Just as a recipe has a specific order—listing ingredients before you start cooking.

A C program needs a specific structure so the computer knows how to read and run it.
By organizing the code into six distinct parts, you ensure that the "tools" and "ingredients" are ready before the "cooking" begins.

Using this structure makes your code neat and helps you find mistakes easily because everything has its own designated place.




## The preprocessor Section:

### Definitions of Preprocessor Headers:
The preprocessor headers are placed at the very top of a C program. These are **libraries** that contain functions—or tools—that you can use in your program.

Think of these libraries like **toolboxes** owned by a carpenter. A toolbox contains tools like a hammer or nails. When the carpenter needs to fix something, they do not have to recreate or redesign the hammer from scratch; they simply grab it from the box. They don't have to "reinvent the wheel"—they just include the boxes they need.

### Breaking down the syntax:

When you see a line like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

```

There are three important parts to understand:

* **The `#` symbol:** This is a "pre-instruction." It tells the computer to prepare these tools **before** it starts reading your main code.
* **The `< >` brackets:** These tell the computer to look in the "standard" storage area where the built-in C toolboxes are kept.
* **The `.h` extension:** This stands for **Header**. It is like an index or a manual at the top of the toolbox that lists all the tools inside.

**Example: The Printing Tool**

For example, there is a tool in C used to print or display messages on the screen. This tool (called `printf`) lives inside a toolbox called **stdio.h** (which stands for **Standard Input/Output**). To use this tool, you must tell the computer to "include" that toolbox at the very top of your file so the computer knows where to find it.

## The main function:

### The definition of main function:

The main function is the starting point of the program. Think of it like the front door of a building. When you enter a building, you have to look for the front door; without it, you can't enter and do whatever you want to do.

Similarly, in a C program structure, the computer or the compiler looks for a specific name to know where the "instructions" begin. This starting point is a function called **main**. Without it, the computer doesn't know which line of code to run first.

Every C program must have this function because this is where the compiler starts. Imagine a building without a front door—how can anyone enter?

### The general syntax of the main function:

The general syntax of the main function is:

```c
int main() {
  /* The instructions of the program here. */

  return 0;
}

```
### The components of the main function:

#### The name of the function main():

When you write the main function, you use the keyword **main** and the brackets.
While the computer will not throw a syntax error if you add a space,
 the common practice is writing them without a space between them: `main()`.

#### The return value type **int**:
You might notice the word `int` before `main` and the `return 0;` at the end.
This tells the computer that when the program finishes, it will send back a number (an integer).

In C, every function usually tells the computer what kind of "answer" or "result" it will give back.
The word int is short for integer (a whole number).

By putting int before main, you are making a promise to the computer.
You are saying: "When this program finishes its job, I promise to give you back a whole number.



#### The return statement inside the function:
The **return 0;** statement is like a "mission accomplished" signal. By sending the number **0** back to the computer,
the program says, "Everything finished correctly without any problems.
