title: Introduction to structure of C program
---

The C programming structure follows a well-structured manner, much like a recipe for cooking a meal.
Just as a recipe has a specific order—listing ingredients before you start cooking.

A C program needs a specific structure so the computer knows how to read and run it.
By organizing the code into six distinct parts, you ensure that the "tools" and "ingredients" are ready before the "cooking" begins.

Using this structure makes your code neat and helps you find mistakes easily because everything has its own designated place.




## The preprocessor Section:


That is a very good explanation! Your building analogy makes the concept easy to understand. To make it more complete, there is one small but important part of the "main door" that you missed: the **return 0;** statement.

Here is the updated version with that addition:

## The main function:

### The definition of main function:

The main function is the starting point of the program. Think of it like the front door of a building. When you enter a building, you have to look for the front door; without it, you can't enter and do whatever you want to do.

Similarly, in a C program structure, the computer or the compiler looks for a specific name to know where the "instructions" begin. This starting point is a function called **main**. Without it, the computer doesn't know which line of code to run first.

Every C program must have this function because this is where the compiler starts. Imagine a building without a front door—how can anyone enter?

### The general syntax of the main function:

The general syntax of the main function is:

```c
int main() {
  /* The instructions of the program here. */

  return 0;
}

```
### The components of the main function:

#### The name of the function main():

When you write the main function, you use the keyword **main** and the brackets.
While the computer will not throw a syntax error if you add a space,
 the common practice is writing them without a space between them: `main()`.

#### The return value type **int**:
 You might notice the word `int` before `main` and the `return 0;` at the end.This tells the computer that when the program finishes, it will send back a number (an integer).

#### The return statement inside the function:
The **return 0;** statement is like a "mission accomplished" signal. By sending the number **0** back to the computer,
the program says, "Everything finished correctly without any problems.
