## What is print function and what is the syntax ?

The print() function is a function that can be used to print whatever you add inside it to the screen.
 If you want to display information on the screen or to make the system show it, you can use the print() function.
The print() function takes text, variables, or whatever you want to print to the screen.

The general syntax of the print() function is:

```Python 
 print("Write any text here")
```
 or

```Python
 print('Write any text here')
```
You can use double quotations or single quotations. It depends on what is inside the function.

-**Case1:**

If the text you want to print contains a single quote, then you have to use double quotes "".

```Python
 print("Write any 'text' here")
```

-**Case2:**

If the text you want to print on the screen contains double quotes,
then you have to use single quotes only so they do not conflict.

```Python
 print('Write any "text" here')
```
