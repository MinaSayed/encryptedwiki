title: The print () function in python

## What is print function and what is the syntax ?

The print() function is a function that can be used to print whatever you add inside it to the screen.
 If you want to display information on the screen or to make the system show it, you can use the print() function.
The print() function takes text, variables, or whatever you want to print to the screen.


## The general syntax of print() function:
The general syntax of the print() function is:

```Python 
 print("Write any text here")
```
 or

```Python
 print('Write any text here')
```

### The parentheses:

### Quotation Marks:
#### What is the purpose of quotation marks?
Quotation marks tell the computer to treat what is inside them as text, which we call a "string." This is different from a variable, which is a name for a piece of data, or a value, like a number.

If you leave out the quotation marks, the computer will try to find a variable with the name you typed. Since you haven't defined any variables yet, the computer won't know what to do. It will get confused and show an error called a **NameError**, because it thinks you are referring to something that doesn’t exist.

**For example:**

```python
print(I LOVE PROGRAMMING)
```

In this case, the user forgot to put quotation marks around the text they want to print.
The computer will try to look for variables named `I` or `LOVE`, but since none exist,
it will panic and throw a **SyntaxError**.

This line:

```python
print(I Love programming)
```

is **invalid Python syntax**. Python sees `I` and `Love` as **variable names**, not text,
because there are **no quotation marks** around them. Since you haven’t defined variables called `I` or `Love`,
 Python gets confused.

That’s why it throws a **SyntaxError**. It also suggests maybe you forgot a comma,
because it sees multiple “words” without proper separation.


The correct way to print text is to enclose it in quotes:

```python
print("I Love programming")
```

This tells Python: “Treat this exactly as text (a string), don’t look for variables.”

**Output:**

```
I Love programming
```

Without the quotes, Python can’t interpret your intent—it only understands text when you wrap it in quotation marks.

We only can't use the quotation marks only if we want to display or print a number value or a variable that contains a
value stored inside it.

**For example:**

```python
secret_code = 123456789
print(secret_code)
```

**Output:**
```python
123456789
```

When I print(secret_code), I do not use quotation marks.
Why? Because I want the computer to look inside the box and print what is there.
If I wrote print("secret_code"), the computer would literally print the words "secret_code" instead of the address.





#### Types of quotation marks:
You can use double quotations or single quotations. It depends on what is inside the function.

##### Case 1:

If the text you want to print contains a single quote, then you have to use double quotes "".

```Python
 print("Write any 'text' here")
```

**Example1:**

Imagine you are trying to bypass a security gate.
To get through, you need to make the system display a specific phrase on the screen.The phrase is:

```
System's Online
```
If you try to write  **print ('System's Online')** , the computer gets confused because it thinks the message ends at the letter m.

So to solve this conflict, we have to use the double quotation mark which will act like a container.
This container holds all the text including the single quotation mark, so the computer does not get confused about where the message starts or ends.

Because the double quotes are on the outside, the single quote inside is treated as just a normal character instead of a command.
This makes sure the code runs correctly and displays the full sentence on the screen without any errors or conflicts.

```Python
print("System's Online")
```

##### Case 2:

If the text you want to print on the screen contains double quotes,
then you have to use single quotes only so they do not conflict.

So to solve this conflict we have to use the double
quotation mark which will act like a container the contain all the text including the single quotation mark.

 

```Python
 print('Write any "text" here')
```
