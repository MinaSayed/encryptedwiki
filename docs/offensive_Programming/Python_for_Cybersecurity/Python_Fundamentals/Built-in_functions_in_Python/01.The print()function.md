title: The print () function in python
---

## What is print function and what is the syntax ?

The print() function is a function that can be used to print whatever you add inside it to the screen.
 If you want to display information on the screen or to make the system show it, you can use the print() function.
The print() function takes text, variables, or whatever you want to print to the screen.

The general syntax of the print() function is:

```Python 
 print("Write any text here")
```
 or

```Python
 print('Write any text here')
```
You can use double quotations or single quotations. It depends on what is inside the function.

-**Case1:**

If the text you want to print contains a single quote, then you have to use double quotes "".

```Python
 print("Write any 'text' here")
```

**Example1:**
Imagine you are trying to bypass a security gate.
To get through, you need to make the system display a specific phrase on the screen.The phrase is:

```
System's Online
```
If you try to write  **print('System's Online')** , the computer gets confused because it thinks the message ends at the letter m.

So to solve this conflict, we have to use the double quotation mark which will act like a container.
This container holds all the text including the single quotation mark, so the computer does not get confused about where the message starts or ends.

Because the double quotes are on the outside, the single quote inside is treated as just a normal character instead of a command.
This makes sure the code runs correctly and displays the full sentence on the screen without any errors or conflicts.

```Python
print("System's Online")
```

**-Case2:**

If the text you want to print on the screen contains double quotes,
then you have to use single quotes only so they do not conflict.

So to solve this conflict we have to use the double
quotation mark which will act like a container the contain all the text including the single quotation mark.

 

```Python
 print('Write any "text" here')
```
