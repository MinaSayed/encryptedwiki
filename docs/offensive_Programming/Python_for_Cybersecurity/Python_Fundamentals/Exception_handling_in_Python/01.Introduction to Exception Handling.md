Here's the corrected version with spelling, grammar, and formatting issues fixed while preserving the original structure, wording, and intent:

## What are types of error in Python:
The errors in Python can be categorized into more than two types of errors, but we will focus here on two types only.

### The syntax errors:
#### Definition of syntax errors:
Syntax errors are the errors that occur when the programmer writes bad code.  
The code is like a sentence in the English language with broken grammar. As we know,

For example, if you tell someone in your conversation a sentence like this: "jkhfldhfhfkljhfjkldf" then the second person in your conversation or the one you communicate with will not understand you and as a result will not perform or do what you need because the sentence isn't grammatically correct.

Instead, if you tell him something like this "Give me your phone," the second person then will understand you well because the sentence is grammatically correct, following the grammar rules.

The programming language is the language that the computer and the programmers can understandand use to communicate with each other.

Similarly, when the programmer writes code that is broken or not understandable, then the computer will not understand what the programmer needs and the computer cannot even start the program because it doesn't understand the rules or the broken language. So the errors which occur because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.

**For example:**  
Imagine you are writing a Python script to scan a network port and inside your code you write this snippet of code:

```python
print("Scanning the port 80"
```

In this snippet of code, the Python interpreter sees that there is a **)** missing and as a result the Python interpreter refuses to start and run the program completely.

**Example-1:**

```python
my_grade = 170
if my_grade < 80
   print("You are good.")
elif my_grade >100:
   print you are excellent.
```
**Output:**
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

In this example, there are two syntax errors. The first one in the if statement—you were missing the colon **:**. And the second syntax error occurred because you didn't write the print function syntax well. So to solve these errors and make the program execute normally, you have to write this:

```python
my_grade = 170
if my_grade < 80:
   print("You are good.")
elif my_grade >100:
   print("you are excellent.")
```

**Output:**
```
you are excellent.
```

The programmer is responsible for correcting these syntax errors.  
Once all syntax errors are corrected, then only program execution will be started.

### The runtime errors:
#### Definition of runtime errors:
Runtime errors are the errors that occur during the run time of the program.
They are not errors in grammar rules of the language but errors that appear or occur after the execution of the program.

These types of errors don't prevent the program from execution, but the termination of the program is abnormal.
Such types of errors are called exceptions and cause the program to terminate abnormally unless handled.


### Why is an Exception more "dangerous" during a live hack than a Syntax Error?
The exceptions can be considered more dangerous than the syntax error in term of security because in the syntax errors
the errors occur before the execution of the program so that the programmer can easily discover it and solve it.
And  the program never runs because it doesn't understand the bad syntax  and no sensitive data leaks to attackers.

but in the runtime errors or exception the error occurs after the exceution of the program and can exposes sensitive information to the
attackers.When an exception occurs, Python automatically prints detailed error messages to help programmers debug.

These messages often include sensitive information like full file paths on the server, database names,
or even parts of secret configuration files.

**For example:**
Imagine a program that can't find a file called /app/configs/secret_db_credentials.json.
The error message will show this exact path to anyone watching - including a hacker.
Now they know exactly where your secret database passwords are stored and the structure of your server folders.


In a live hack situation, attackers deliberately trigger these exceptions by sending bad data.
Each crash reveals more about your system's internals through the stack trace (which shows function names and code flow).
Syntax errors can't be triggered this way since the program never runs,
but exceptions create a constant leak of valuable attack information during the active hack.

A stack trace is like a breadcrumb trail showing exactly which functions your program called right before it crashed.
When your Python program runs into an exception during a live hack, it automatically prints this stack trace.
Think of your code as a chain of dominoes falling one after another—function A calls function B, which calls function C, and so on.
The stack trace lists them all in order, starting from the very last function that caused the problem and working backward to
where your program began.For example, if you see something like this in an error:


```python
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/configs/secret_db_credentials.json'
  File "main.py", line 45, in load_config
    with open(config_path) as f:
  File "server.py", line 123, in start_server
    config = load_config()
  File "app.py", line 10, in <module>
    start_server()
```

This tells the hacker: "Your secret file is at `/app/configs/secret_db_credentials.json`,
the `load_config()` function is on line 45 of `main.py`, and it was called from `start_server()` on line 123 of `server.py`."
 Suddenly they know your exact file structure, function names, and code locations—information
a hacker can use to attack deeper into your system. Syntax errors never how this because the program never even starts running.





## Types of Program Execution Flow
There are two paths that any program can follow when it runs.

### Normal Flow of Program Execution in Python
The normal flow of program execution, as the name suggests, means the program executes from the first line to the end correctly without showing any errors. In a program, if all statements execute successfully according to their conditions and produce the expected output, then that flow is called the normal flow of program execution.

**For example:**
```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
print(f"The result is: {z}")
```
The above program executes successfully from start to end and produces the expected output.

**Output:**
```
The result is: 30
```
The program's execution flow is normal; no errors appear, and it terminates correctly with the expected output.

### Abnormal Flow of Program Execution in Python
While executing statements in a program, if any error occurs at runtime, the program flow terminates abnormally immediately, without executing the remaining statements. This kind of termination is called an abnormal flow of execution. The following example terminates abnormally.

**For example:**
```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
print(f"The sum is: {z/0}")
print(f"The average is: {z/2}")
```
The above program does not execute successfully or produce output.

**Output:**
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```
The program's execution flow is abnormal; a runtime error (Division by zero) appears, and it does not terminate normally or produce the expected output. The program terminates in the middle of execution where the runtime error occurs. As discussed, if a runtime error occurs, it won't execute the remaining statements, so the last print function does not execute.
