Here's the corrected version with spelling, grammar, and formatting issues fixed while preserving the original structure, wording, and intent:

## What are types of error in Python:
The errors in Python can be categorized into more than two types of errors, but we will focus here on two types only.

### The syntax errors:
#### Definition of syntax errors:
Syntax errors are the errors that occur when the programmer writes bad code.  
The code is like a sentence in the English language with broken grammar. As we know, the programming language is the language that the computer and the programmers can understand and use to communicate with each other.

For example, if you tell someone in your conversation a sentence like this: "jkhfldhfhfkljhfjkldf" then the second person in your conversation or the one you communicate with will not understand you and as a result will not perform or do what you need because the sentence isn't grammatically correct.

Instead, if you tell him something like this "Give me your phone," the second person then will understand you well because the sentence is grammatically correct, following the grammar rules.

Similarly, when the programmer writes code that is broken or not understandable, then the computer will not understand what the programmer needs and the computer cannot even start the program because it doesn't understand the rules or the broken language. So the errors which occur because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.

**For example:**  
Imagine you are writing a Python script to scan a network port and inside your code you write this snippet of code:

```python
print("Scanning the port 80"
```

In this snippet of code, the Python interpreter sees that there is a **)** missing and as a result the Python interpreter refuses to start and run the program completely.

**Example-1:**

```python
my_grade = 170
if my_grade < 80
   print("You are good.")
elif my_grade >100:
   print you are excellent.
```
**Output:**
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

In this example, there are two syntax errors. The first one in the if statement—you were missing the colon **:**. And the second syntax error occurred because you didn't write the print function syntax well. So to solve these errors and make the program execute normally, you have to write this:

```python
my_grade = 170
if my_grade < 80:
   print("You are good.")
elif my_grade >100:
   print("you are excellent.")
```

**Output:**
```
you are excellent.
```

The programmer is responsible for correcting these syntax errors.  
Once all syntax errors are corrected, then only program execution will be started.

### The runtime errors:
#### Definition of runtime errors:
Runtime errors are the errors that occur during the run time of the program. They are not errors in grammar rules of the language but errors that appear or occur after the execution of the program. These types of errors don't prevent the program from execution, but the termination of the program is abnormal. Such types of errors are called exceptions.
