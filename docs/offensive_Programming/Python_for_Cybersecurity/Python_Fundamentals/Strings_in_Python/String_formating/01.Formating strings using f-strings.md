title: Formating string using f-strings method
---

## What is f-string method and how to use it?
Before write any academic explanation of the f-string method we have to explore the purpose of this method and why do
we need to use it.Assume you are writing a script to log your progress on a system.
You want the screen to show a message like:

```
 Scanning port 80
```
This text is a combination of a piece of text ( as string ) that is "Scanning Port " and an integer variable which
represent the number of the port that be scanned this number is an integer variable which can not be hardcoded not
a constant it would be in some cases 80, 334, 21..etc.

So how can we combine a piece of text or a string with a variable
So the f-string method is used to solve this problem i can easily combine a string with a variable in one option
To do this, you need to combine a piece of text (a string) with your variable.

In modern Python, the easiest way to put a variable inside a sentence is using an **f-string**.
You put an f before the first quote and put your variable name inside curly brackets **{}**.

The general syntax will be:

```Python
print (f"Any piece of text and {variable}")
```

**For example:**

```Python
target = "Server-A"

print(f"Attacking {target}")
```

This will display: Attacking Server-A
