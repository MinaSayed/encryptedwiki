## What is Variables in Python Porgoramming?
Variables in Python can be seen as a box where you keep your important items, like toys or other things.
You can also think of them as a container that holds water.
In the hacking world, variables are very important.
They are used to save helpful data so you can use it later.

For example, if I am looking into a suspicious server, I need a place to store that server's IP address.
This allows me to use that address again for different tasks later on.
