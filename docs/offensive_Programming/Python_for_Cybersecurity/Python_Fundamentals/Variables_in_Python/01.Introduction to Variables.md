title: Introduction to Variables in Python

## What is Variables in Python Porgoramming?
Variables in Python can be seen as a box where you keep your important items, like toys or other things.
You can also think of them as a container that holds water.
In the hacking world, variables are very important.
They are used to save helpful data so you can use it later.

**For example:**

For example, if I am looking into a suspicious server, I need a place to store that server's IP address.
This allows me to use that address again for different tasks later on.


Instead of writing this down on paper, we will use Python to create a "box" (a Variable) to store this address in the computer's memory.
This allows your hacking tools to use that address automatically later.In Python, we name the box first, then use the = sign to put something inside it.


```Python
server_ip = "192.168.1.1"

```

Because an IP address contains dots and numbers, Python sees it as "text" (a String).
You must put the address inside quotation marks, like this: "192.168.1.5"
