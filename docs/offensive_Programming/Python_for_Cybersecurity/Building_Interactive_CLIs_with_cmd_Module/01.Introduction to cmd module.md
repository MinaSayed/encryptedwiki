title: Introduction to cmd module

## An overview of the REPL loop concept:

Before you touch the `cmd` module, you must understand the REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop).
Every interactive program—from your Python shell to a Linux terminal—runs on this fundamental cycle:

* **Read**: The program pauses and waits for you to type something.
* **Eval (Evaluate)**: The program takes that text and determines what it means.
* **Print**: The program displays the result.
* **Loop**: The program returns to Step 1 and waits again.

In Python’s `cmd` module, this loop is handled by a method called `cmdloop()`.
Without this loop, a program runs once and terminates. With it, you create an interactive environment.

**For example:**

If you want to write a simple or primitive Python interactive shell following the REPL concept,
you can use a `while` loop combined with `try`–`except` blocks.

```python
while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("ENTER COMMAND > ")

        if user_input.strip().lower() == "hello":
            print("Hi, there!")
        elif user_input.strip().lower() == "status":
            print("System is running.")
        elif user_input.strip().lower() == "exit":
            break
        else:
            print("Unknown command")

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nShutdown signaled")
        break
```

---

In the previous example, the line that asks the user to enter or provide input represents the **READ phase**.
In this phase, the computer only reads whatever the user enters.

```python
user_input = input("ENTER COMMAND > ")
```

---

In the **EVAL phase**, the computer evaluates the user input.
It takes whatever the user enters, interprets its meaning, and checks whether it matches the program’s logic.
The following lines represent the **EVAL phase**:

```python
if user_input.strip().lower() == "hello":
elif user_input.strip().lower() == "status":
elif user_input.strip().lower() == "exit":
```

---

In the **PRINT phase**, the program outputs a response based on the evaluated input.
The following lines represent the **PRINT phase**:

```python
print("Hi, there!")
print("System is running.")
print("Unknown command")
print("\nShutdown signaled")
```

---

In the **LOOP phase**, the program returns to the beginning and waits for new input.
This phase is represented by the infinite loop itself:

```python
while True:
```

As long as no `break` statement is triggered, the program continues cycling through **READ → EVAL → PRINT → LOOP**,
which is exactly what defines a REPL-based interactive program.
