## What is os module?
os module is a python module which contains a lot of functions and attributes that help python scripts to interact directly with Operating system.os module acts as a bridge between the OS and the python scripts because the python scripts can't interact directly with the Operating systems.


Operating systems can manipulate the file system and the memory and the CPU while the python script is a blind code that can live only in it's own memory.What is outside the memory the python script can not interact with so it comes the role or the importance of the os module.


Think of the computer as a big house full of rooms and details. The Python script is like a guest staying in this house. The operating system is the house manager who controls everything.The guest can't go around the house alone or touch things directly. He needs the house manager to guide him and carry out his requests. The Python script works the same way—it needs the house manager (OS) to access the house (hardware and resources).


The os module is like the special protocol or rules the guest uses to talk to the house manager. It's an interface or API. So the process goes: Python script (guest) → os module (protocol) → operating system (house manager) → hardware (house).No matter what kind of house it is, the os module gives the Python script a consistent way to ask the house manager for help across different operating systems.

It allows your program to perform tasks that you would normally do manually, such as creating folders, renaming files, or checking which operating system you are using


## Importing the os module:
To import this module inside the python file you write this:

```
import os
```

You write import os at the top of your Python file. Now you can use all os tools.When you write import os, Python does NOT copy all content into your file. That's too big and slow!

Python looks in special folders (like lib or site-packages) and loads the os module into memory. Now you can use os.function().
