## Navigation of directories:

### Navigating the current working directory:
Imagine the computer is a big house. If you want to navigate in the computer, you have to know your current location or you want to know where are you right now? Because this would be the starting point that you will use to navigate through the house.

So to know where are you right now? There is a tool (a function) that can be used to get your current working directory of the directory that you are standing in:

```python
os.getcwd()
```

**get**: It means fetch or grabs the information  
**cwd**: it stands for the current working directory  

This is a function that takes no arguments. It used with empty parentheses only—no arguments needed to use it. Think of it like asking someone, "Where am I?". You don't need to give them any extra information for them to tell you your own location. In Python, you just write it with empty parentheses:

```python
os.getcwd()
```

It doesn't need to "take" anything because its only job is to "give" you the current address.

This function is "portable," which means it works exactly the same way on all kinds of computers—no matter if you're using Windows (like on a regular PC), Linux (common on servers), or Mac (Apple computers).

You type os.getcwd() with the exact same spelling and format every single time. Your code doesn't need to change at all when you move it from one computer to another. That's what makes it portable—it "travels" easily between different systems without breaking.

Even though you write the command the same way everywhere, the answer you get back will look a bit different because each operating system has its own special rules for showing folder paths:

**System Example of what os.getcwd() returns:**

| **Windows** | **Linux/Mac** |
|-------------|---------------|
| `C:\Users\Documents\MyProject` (Uses backslashes `\`) | `/home/user/documents/myproject` (Uses forward slashes `/`) |

So, the os module acts like a smart translator. You speak "Python" to it, and it goes behind the scenes to talk to Windows or Linux in their own languages to get the answer for you.
