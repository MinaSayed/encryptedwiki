## Navigation of directories:

### Navigating the current working directory:
Imagine the computer is a big house. If you want to navigate in the computer, you have to know your current location or you want to know where are you right now? Because this would be the starting point that you will use to navigate through the house.

So to know where are you right now? There is a tool (a function) that can be used to get your current working directory of the directory that you are standing in:

```python
os.getcwd()
```

**get**: It means fetch or grabs the information  
**cwd**: it stands for the current working directory  

This is a function that takes no arguments. It used with empty parentheses only—no arguments needed to use it. Think of it like asking someone, "Where am I?". You don't need to give them any extra information for them to tell you your own location. In Python, you just write it with empty parentheses:

```python
os.getcwd()
```

It doesn't need to "take" anything because its only job is to "give" you the current address.

This function is "portable," which means it works exactly the same way on all kinds of computers—no matter if you're using Windows (like on a regular PC), Linux (common on servers), or Mac (Apple computers).

You type os.getcwd() with the exact same spelling and format every single time. Your code doesn't need to change at all when you move it from one computer to another. That's what makes it portable—it "travels" easily between different systems without breaking.

Even though you write the command the same way everywhere, the answer you get back will look a bit different because each operating system has its own special rules for showing folder paths:

**System Example of what os.getcwd() returns:**

| **Windows** | **Linux/Mac** |
|-------------|---------------|
| `C:\Users\Documents\MyProject` (Uses backslashes `\`) | `/home/user/documents/myproject` (Uses forward slashes `/`) |

So, the os module acts like a smart translator. You speak "Python" to it, and it goes behind the scenes to talk to Windows or Linux in their own languages to get the answer for you.

### Changing the current directory:

#### How to use it?

If you want to change your directory or your current directory there is a tool or a fuction that can do this job this tool is:

```python
os.chdir( )
```

where:

- ch : stands for change to change the currrent working directory

- dir: is stands for the directory a fancy name for folder.

To use this tool you have to determine the new path or new address you want to move your program focus on it.It moves the focus (the eye) of the program, not the files of the program themselves.

**Let's use the "Flashlight" Analogy: 🔦**

- Imagine your computer is a dark warehouse full of shelves (folders).

- Your Python script is a person standing in that warehouse holding a flashlight.

- Where the flashlight is pointing is the Current Working Directory.

- When you run os.chdir(), you are telling the person to walk to a different aisle.

- The person (the script) moves their body and their light to the new aisle, but they did not move the boxes on the shelves.

**In technical terms:**
The .py file (your code) stays exactly where you saved it on the hard drive.The "Focus" (the point of view) of the running program changes.This is matter because If your code is sitting in Folder_A, but you use os.chdir('Folder_B'), your program is now "looking" inside Folder_B.If you try to open a file that is sitting right next to your script in Folder_A, the program will say "I can't find it!" because its "flashlight" is now pointing at Folder_B.


This function take one input or one parameter which is the path or the address of the new directory you want to move your program's focus to it.You  must put the path (the address) inside the parentheses as a string (inside single quotes '  '  or  double quotes "  " ).

```python
os.chdir("Path")
```

or

```python
os.chdir('path')
```

The output of this function will be nothing after you run this command, the computer won't print anything.It just moves silently. To verify you actually moved, you would need to call os.getcwd() again.

**Example:**
```python
import os

#1. Check where we are first
print("Starting at:", os.getcwd())
#2. Command the program to move to a specific folder
os.chdir('C:/Users/Documents/MyProject')
#3. Check again to see the new location
print("Now I am at:", os.getcwd())
```

**Notes:**

- A Common "Trap" for Beginners:
When you use Windows, paths often look like this: C:\Users\Documents. In Python, the backslash (\) is a "special character." If you try to use it in os.chdir(), Python might get confused.

Two ways to stay safe:

Use Forward Slashes: Just use / instead of \. Python is smart enough to fix it for you.
```python
os.chdir('C:/Users/Documents')
```

The "Raw" String: Put an r before your quotes. This tells Python: "Treat this text exactly as it is, no special characters."
```python
os.chdir(r'C:\Users\Documents')
```

- Using the relative path and absolute path:

You can use the relative path and the aboslute path inside this function.imagine you want to move to a folder that is inside your current room. For example, you are in Documents and you want to enter a folder called Photos.Instead of typing the whole long address (C:/Users/Documents/Photos), you can just type the name of the folder: 

```python
os.chdir('Photos')
```

#### What is the purpose of this tool or function?

If we can just use **Absolute Paths** (the full address) to find any file, why bother "moving" the program at all?Here are the three main reasons why programmers use `os.chdir()`:

**1. It makes your code "Cleaner" and "Shorter" ✍️**

Imagine you have 10 files in a folder called:

```
C:/Users/John/Documents/Year_2024/Projects/Python/Data_Files/
```

* **Without `chdir`:** Every time you want to open a file, you have to type that giant address:

```
open('C:/Users/John/Documents/Year_2024/Projects/Python/Data_Files/file1.txt')
```

* **With `chdir`:** You move there once, and then you just type the short name:
```
os.chdir('C:/Users/John/Documents/Year_2024/Projects/Python/Data_Files/')
open('file1.txt')
```

It saves you from typing (and making typos!) in long addresses.

**2. Working with "Batches" of Files 📦 :**

If you have a folder full of 100 photos and you want to rename all of them, it is much easier to "step inside" that folder first. Once you are inside, you can tell Python: *"Look at everything here and add 'Fixed_' to the name."* It is easier for the program to work on "what is right in front of it."

**3. Using Shared Tools 🛠️:**

Sometimes, you might download a script or a tool that **only** works if it is running inside a specific folder (because it looks for its own settings or images in the "current room"). By using `os.chdir()`, you can bring your program's focus to that tool's folder so it can run correctly.



**A Simple Life Example:**

Think of your computer like a **Kitchen**.

* **The Absolute Path way:** You stand in the hallway and reach your long arm all the way into the cupboard to grab a plate, then reach all the way to the fridge to grab an egg. It's exhausting!
* **The `os.chdir()` way:** You **walk into the kitchen**. Now, the plates, the fridge, and the stove are all "Relative" to you. Everything is within easy reach.


## Listing contents of a directory:

### What is os.listdir( ) function?
The `os.listdir()` is a function inside the os module that can be used to list the content of a folder. It tells you what files or folders are sitting inside that folder. If you want to explore the content of a specific folder/directory, then this tool will enable you to do so. When you use `os.listdir()`, you are asking Python to look at a folder and give you a list of names for everything sitting inside it.

There are some important facts about this function you have to take into consideration:

- **The function returns a list of strings:**

This function only returns a list of the folder's content as strings, such as:

```
['notes.txt', 'Photos', 'Budget.xlsx']
```

- **It is shallow:**

It is shallow" means it doesn't dig deep.It only shows you what is in the immediate folder. If there is a folder named Photos, it will tell you the folder exists, but it won't show you the pictures inside Photos yet.

Think of `os.listdir()` like peeking into a single drawer. It shows you everything sitting right there on top—like files and folders. But if one of those things is another drawer (like your "Photos" folder), it just says "Hey, there's a drawer here" without opening it to show the photos inside.


**For Example:**
```
os.listdir('.')  # Shows: ['Photos', 'notes.txt']
# But NOT the images inside Photos!
```

This keeps it simple and fast—no automatic deep dive into subfolders.


- **The order of the content:**

The names aren't always in alphabetical order; they usually appear in the order the computer stores them.`os.listdir()` gives folder names in the order the computer saves them on the disk. This order is not always A to Z. It can be different each time.

**For example:**

```
# It might show:
['Budget.xlsx', 'notes.txt', 'Photos']

# Or this on another computer:
['Photos', 'notes.txt', 'Budget.xlsx']
```

To get A to Z order, use `sorted(os.listdir('folder'))`.



### How to use it?

You have two simple ways to use `os.listdir()`.

#### Way 1: Check your current folder 
If you don't put anything inside the parentheses (), it looks at the folder where your Python code is running right now.This checks the folder where your Python script is running. 
No path needed—just empty parentheses.

**For example:**

 Say your script is in a folder called `MyProject` with these files: `script.py`, `data.csv`, `images/`.

```python
import os

content = os.listdir()  # Empty = current folder

print(content)

# Output: ['script.py', 'data.csv', 'images']
```

**What happens step-by-step:**
1. Python looks where your script lives.
2. Lists all files/folders there.
3. Returns them as a list of names.

#### Way 2: Check a different folder (detailed examples)
You can look inside any other folder without changing your position. Just give it the folder's path (like an address).
Give a path to any folder. Use forward slashes `/` (works on Windows/Mac/Linux) or double backslashes `\\` on Windows.

**Example A: Relative path (near your current folder)**

```python
import os

content = os.listdir('images')  # Folder inside current one

print(content)

# Output: ['photo1.jpg', 'photo2.png']
```

**Example B: Absolute path (full address from disk root)**

```python
import os

music_list = os.listdir('C:/Users/YourName/Music')  # Windows

# Or: music_list = os.listdir('/home/user/Music')  # Linux/Mac

print(music_list)
# Output: ['song1.mp3', 'playlist.m3u', 'Albums']
```

**Example C: Handling errors**

```python
import os

try:
    files = os.listdir('nonexistent_folder')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Folder not found!")
```

**Notes:**

- Paths can be strings like `'folder/'` or `'../parent_folder'`.
- Always `import os` first.
- Returns list of strings (filenames only, no full paths).Since os.listdir() only gives you a list of text strings, the computer doesn't "know" if a name is a file or a folder just by looking at the list.


## Creating new directories:
There are two ways to create new directories :
### Way 1 Creating one single folder (os.mkdir):
#### Creating a single directory in the current location:
If you want to create a single folder in your current folder you can use this function:

```python
 os.mkdir("FolderName")
```
where:

- mk stands for make ro create or make new folder.
- dir: stands for directory

This function only take the name of the new directory as a string using single quote (' ') or double quote (" ").

**For example:**

 If You want to create a folder called "Photos" inside your current location.you write:
 
```python
 os.mkdir("Photos")
```


**Notes:**

- It only works if the "parent" folder already exists. If you try to create Movies/Action/Batman and the Movies folder doesn't exist yet, it will crash with an error.

- If you run os.mkdir('photos') and the folder already exists, Python will crash and show an error called: FileExistsError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'photos'.It’s like trying to build a room where a wall already stands; the computer doesn't want to accidentally overwrite or mess up what is already there.To prevent your program from crashing, you should always "Ask before you Act." We use the tool we talked about earlier: `os.path.exists()`.
	
	```python
	import os
	
	folder_name = 'photos'
	
	#1. Ask: Does this folder already exist?
	if not os.path.exists(folder_name):
	    # 2. If it does NOT exist, create it
	    os.mkdir(folder_name)
	    print("Folder created successfully!")
	else:
	    # 3. If it DOES exist, just give a friendly message
	    print("The folder is already there, no need to create it.")
	
	```


#### Creating a single directory in different location:
You are not limited to the "room" you are standing in. You can build a folder anywhere in the house as long as you have the address (the path).Instead of just giving the name of the folder to `os.mkdir()`, you give it the **Path** of where you want that folder to be.

**For example:

```python
import os
# Creating a folder in a completely different location
os.mkdir('C:/Users/Documents/New_Project')
```

Just like in real life, you can only build a room if:

1. **The path exists:** You can't build a room in a house that hasn't been built yet. (The parent folder must exist).
    
2. **You have permission:** You can't build a room in your neighbor's house! Some parts of the computer (like system folders) are "locked," and Python will give you a `PermissionError` if you try to create something there.
