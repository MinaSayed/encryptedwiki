## Navigation of directories:

### Navigating the current working directory:
Imagine the computer is a big house. If you want to navigate in the computer, you have to know your current location or you want to know where are you right now? Because this would be the starting point that you will use to navigate through the house.

So to know where are you right now? There is a tool (a function) that can be used to get your current working directory of the directory that you are standing in:

```python
os.getcwd()
```

**get**: It means fetch or grabs the information  
**cwd**: it stands for the current working directory  

This is a function that takes no arguments. It used with empty parentheses only—no arguments needed to use it. Think of it like asking someone, "Where am I?". You don't need to give them any extra information for them to tell you your own location. In Python, you just write it with empty parentheses:

```python
os.getcwd()
```

It doesn't need to "take" anything because its only job is to "give" you the current address.

This function is "portable," which means it works exactly the same way on all kinds of computers—no matter if you're using Windows (like on a regular PC), Linux (common on servers), or Mac (Apple computers).

You type os.getcwd() with the exact same spelling and format every single time. Your code doesn't need to change at all when you move it from one computer to another. That's what makes it portable—it "travels" easily between different systems without breaking.

Even though you write the command the same way everywhere, the answer you get back will look a bit different because each operating system has its own special rules for showing folder paths:

**System Example of what os.getcwd() returns:**

| **Windows** | **Linux/Mac** |
|-------------|---------------|
| `C:\Users\Documents\MyProject` (Uses backslashes `\`) | `/home/user/documents/myproject` (Uses forward slashes `/`) |

So, the os module acts like a smart translator. You speak "Python" to it, and it goes behind the scenes to talk to Windows or Linux in their own languages to get the answer for you.

### Changing the current directory:

#### What is the purpose of this tool or function:

If you want to change your directory or your current directory there is a tool or a fuction that can do this job this tool is:

,,,python

os.chdir(  )
,,,

where :

ch : stands for change to change the currrent working directory

dir: is stands for the directory a fancy name for folder.

To use this tool you have to determine the new path or new address you want to move your program focus on it.It moves the focus (the eye) of the program, not the files of the program themselves.

**Let's use the "Flashlight" Analogy: 🔦**

- Imagine your computer is a dark warehouse full of shelves (folders).

- Your Python script is a person standing in that warehouse holding a flashlight.

- Where the flashlight is pointing is the Current Working Directory.

- When you run os.chdir(), you are telling the person to walk to a different aisle.

- The person (the script) moves their body and their light to the new aisle, but they did not move the boxes on the shelves.

**In technical terms:**
The .py file (your code) stays exactly where you saved it on the hard drive.The "Focus" (the point of view) of the running program changes.This is matter because If your code is sitting in Folder_A, but you use os.chdir('Folder_B'), your program is now "looking" inside Folder_B.If you try to open a file that is sitting right next to your script in Folder_A, the program will say "I can't find it!" because its "flashlight" is now pointing at Folder_B.

#### How to use it?

This function take one input or one parameter which is the path or the address of the new directory you want to move your program's focus to it.You  must put the path (the address) inside the parentheses as a string (inside single quotes '  '  or  double quotes "  " ).

```python
os.chdir("Path")
```

or

```python
os.chdir('path')
```

The output of this function will be nothing after you run this command, the computer won't print anything.It just moves silently. To verify you actually moved, you would need to call os.getcwd() again.

**Example:**
```python
import os

#1. Check where we are first
print("Starting at:", os.getcwd())
#2. Command the program to move to a specific folder
os.chdir('C:/Users/Documents/MyProject')
#3. Check again to see the new location
print("Now I am at:", os.getcwd())
```

**Note:**

- A Common "Trap" for Beginners:
When you use Windows, paths often look like this: C:\Users\Documents. In Python, the backslash (\) is a "special character." If you try to use it in os.chdir(), Python might get confused.

Two ways to stay safe:

Use Forward Slashes: Just use / instead of \. Python is smart enough to fix it for you.
```python
os.chdir('C:/Users/Documents')
```

The "Raw" String: Put an r before your quotes. This tells Python: "Treat this text exactly as it is, no special characters."
```python
os.chdir(r'C:\Users\Documents')
```

- Using the relative path and absolute path:

You can use the relative path and the aboslute path inside this function.imagine you want to move to a folder that is inside your current room. For example, you are in Documents and you want to enter a folder called Photos.Instead of typing the whole long address (C:/Users/Documents/Photos), you can just type the name of the folder: 

,,,

os.chdir('Photos')

,,,
