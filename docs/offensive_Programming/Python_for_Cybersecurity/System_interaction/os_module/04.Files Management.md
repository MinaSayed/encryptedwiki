## What is a file and what are the differences between a file and a folder?


## Removing files using os module:
### Removing an existing file :

If you try to use os.remove() on a folder, Python usually throws an OSError or a PermissionError. Basically, it's Python saying, "Wait! This is a room (folder), not a piece of paper (file). I don't have the right tool for this!"

**For example:**

### Removing a non-existing file:
If you try to use os.remove("fileName") for a file that does not exist, Python will immediately stop your program and show a specific error.On most computers, you will see an error called FileNotFoundError. It looks something like this: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'fileName'.Python does this because it wants to be sure you aren't making a mistake. It is saying: "You asked me to delete something, but I can't find it!".

As we saw with creating folders, the best way to handle this is to check before you delete.You can use os.path.exists() to make sure the file is there before you try to remove it.

**For example:**

```Python
import os

filename = "test.txt"

# 1. Check if it's actually there
if os.path.exists(filename):
    # 2. It exists, so it's safe to delete
    os.remove(filename)
    print("File deleted successfully!")
else:
    # 3. It's not there, so we just print a message instead of crashing
    print("The file was already gone, no action taken.")
```
