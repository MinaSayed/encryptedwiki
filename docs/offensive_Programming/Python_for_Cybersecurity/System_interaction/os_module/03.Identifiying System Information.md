## Identifying the Operating system type using os.name :

### What is os.name?

System information identity  means knowing the identity of the system run on the computer. 
The first information is knowing the operating system run on the machine or knowing whether the operating system is Windows, Linux or Mac OS. 
Knowing the type of operating system is the first thing anyone should know before dealing or interacting with the system because each operating system has its own rules for paths and files.
For example if I want to reach a specific file in the machine I have to know its address in the realm of computer we call it the path but the rules of the paths are different and OS-specific.
The path in Windows is different from the path in Linux and Mac each one has its own rules of formatting.


Imagine you are a ghost inside a computer. You want to open a door, but you don't know if you are in a house (Windows) or a castle (Linux). Every OS has its own "language" and its own rules for paths and files.The os module is your translator. It tells your Python code exactly where it is and who it is talking to. Without it, your code is "blind" to the world outside the Python interpreter.


To identify the operating system that runs on the system, we use a constant string attribute. It isn't a function; we don't put brackets ( ) after it, but it is a constant string attribute. 
```python
os.name
```

In the world of objects, a function like os.getcwd( ) is a method or an action. It goes and "does" work to find the answer.
An attribute (like os.name) is just a piece of data sitting in memory. It is a variable that the os module already filled with information when you imported it. 
When you run import os, the module checks the system immediately. It stores the result in a variable named name.

- If you are on Windows, os.name will always be 'nt'.
- If you are on Linux, Mac, or Unix, os.name will be 'posix'.
