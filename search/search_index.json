To build a tool that feels like a real \"app,\" the program must not stop. It must enter a Loop.</p> <p>Think of a loop like a guard at a gate. The guard does not go home after the first person walks through. The guard waits, asks for a \"command\" or \"ID,\" processes it, and then goes back to waiting. This is called a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).</p> <p>Every interactive program\u2014from your Python shell to a Linux terminal\u2014runs on this fundamental cycle:</p> <ul> <li>Read: The program pauses and waits for you to type something.</li> <li>Eval (Evaluate): The program takes that text and determines what it means.</li> <li>Print: The program displays the result.</li> <li>Loop: The program returns to Step 1 and waits again.</li> </ul> <p>The cmd module automates this loop so you don't have to write it yourself. But if you don't understand that your program is now \"trapped\" in a circle, you will never control it.</p> <p>In Python\u2019s <code>cmd</code> module, this loop is handled by a method called <code>cmdloop()</code>. Without this loop, a program runs once and terminates. With it, you create an interactive environment.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>If you want to write a simple or primitive Python interactive shell following the REPL concept, you can use a <code>while</code> loop combined with <code>try</code>\u2013<code>except</code> blocks.</p> <pre><code>while True:\n    try:\n        user_input = input(\"ENTER COMMAND &gt; \")\n        user_input_clean = user_input.strip().lower() \n        if user_input_clean  == \"hello\":\n            print(\"Hi, there!\")\n        elif user_input_clean  == \"status\":\n            print(\"System is running.\")\n        elif user_input_clean == \"exit\":\n            break\n        else:\n            print(\"Unknown command\")\n\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"\\nShutdown signaled\")\n        break  \n</code></pre> <p>In the previous example, the line that asks the user to enter or provide input represents the READ phase. In this phase, the computer only reads whatever the user enters.</p> <pre><code>user_input = input(\"ENTER COMMAND &gt; \")\n</code></pre> <p>In the EVAL phase, the computer evaluates the user input. It takes whatever the user enters, interprets its meaning, and checks whether it matches the program\u2019s logic.</p> <p>In the Eval phase, the danger isn't just \"doing an action.\" The danger is untrusted input. If your evaluation logic is weak, a user could enter something that crashes the process, leaks data, or bypasses security. You are the gatekeeper; if your logic is flawed, the \"gate\" is useless.</p> <p>The following lines represent the EVAL phase:</p> <pre><code>if user_input.strip().lower() == \"hello\":\nelif user_input.strip().lower() == \"status\":\nelif user_input.strip().lower() == \"exit\":\n</code></pre> <p>In the PRINT phase, the program outputs a response based on the evaluated input. The following lines represent the PRINT phase:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Hi, there!\")\nprint(\"System is running.\")\nprint(\"Unknown command\")\nprint(\"\\nShutdown signaled\")\n</code></pre> <p>In the LOOP phase, the program returns to the beginning and waits for new input.

Each command is written as a method inside your custom class that inherits from cmd.Cmd.</p> <p>The naming convention is important: each command method must start with do_ followed by the name of the command. For example, if you want the command to be hello, you define a method called do_hello.</p> <p>Inside the method, you write the instructions for what should happen when the user types that command. The method can also take an argument, usually called arg, which holds any extra text the user types after the command. This allows your commands to accept input dynamically, so they are not limited to fixed actions.</p> <p>The <code>cmd</code> module always gives your command one raw string as the argument and does not split it automatically. The reason is that a space character does not always mean a new argument. Sometimes a space is just part of the same text.The module cannot guess the user\u2019s intention.</p> <p>Think of the cmd module as a very polite receptionist. It listens carefully, writes down exactly what you said, and refuses to guess your intentions.</p> <p>When you type a command in a cmd.Cmd shell, everything after the command name is handed to your method as one raw string (arg). No splitting. No interpretation. Just the text.</p> <p>For example:</p> <p>If the user writes:</p> <pre><code>note This is my long note\n</code></pre> <p>What the command really needs is this single value:</p> <pre><code>arg = \"This is my long note\"\n</code></pre> <p>If <code>cmd</code> split the argument automatically, it would become:</p> <p><pre><code>[\"This\", \"is\", \"my\", \"long\", \"note\"]\n</code></pre> Now the program has a problem.Were those five separate arguments? Or was the user trying to write one note containing spaces?</p> <p>The cmd module cannot know that safely.It cannot guess the intention of the user.</p> <p>If the tool automatically treats spaces as separators, it is making an assumption about what the user meant. The <code>cmd</code> module avoids this mistake by passing the input as a raw string and letting the command itself decide  how to interpret it. That way, the program stays correct instead of guessing.</p> <p>So the program passing yhe raw string:</p> <p><pre><code>\"This is a long note\"\n</code></pre> it avoids making a wrong assumption. The command author\u2014not the framework\u2014decides how to interpret the text.</p> <p>This design gives you freedom:</p> <p>-You can treat the whole string as one value (notes, messages, SQL queries, search text).</p> <p>-You can split it yourself if your command truly expects multiple arguments.</p> <p>-You can implement quoting rules, flags, or custom parsing later.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>import cmd\n\nclass SimpleShell(cmd.Cmd):\n    def do_hello(self, arg):\n        print(\"Hi from the module!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    SimpleShell().cmdloop()\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation of the example:</p> <ul> <li><code>do_hello</code> is a command that the user can type in the shell.</li> <li><code>arg</code> contains any text the user types after the command.</li> <li><code>cmdloop()</code> starts the interactive loop where the user can type commands repeatedly.</li> </ul> <p>Example-1: <pre><code>import cmd\n\nclass SimpleShell(cmd.Cmd):\n    def do_greet(self, arg):\n        if arg:\n            print(f\"Hello, {arg}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Hello, stranger\")\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    SimpleShell().cmdloop()\n</code></pre></p> <p>Example-2: <pre><code>class StatusShell(cmd.Cmd):\n   def do_status(self, arg):\n       if arg:\n           print(\"Your status is {arg}\")\n       else:\n           print(\"Your status is missing!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\"\n   StatusShell().cmdloop()\n</code></pre></p> <p>Here\u2019s the same idea, cleaned up and explained plainly, without changing the meaning\u2014just tightening the logic and fixing one small naming slip.</p> <p>When a user types a command like <code>status online</code> into a program built with Python\u2019s <code>cmd</code> module, the module first looks at the first word. That first word is treated as the command name. In this case, the command is <code>status</code>.</p> <p>The <code>cmd</code> module then checks whether a method named <code>do_status</code> exists on your command class. If that method exists, the module knows that <code>status</code> is a valid command and that <code>do_status</code> is the method that should handle it.</p> <p>Everything after the command name is treated as one raw string. Here, the remaining text is <code>online</code>, so the module passes that exact string as the argument. As a result, it calls:</p> <p><code>do_status(self, \"online\")</code></p> <p>The important detail is that the argument is not split for you. Even if there were multiple words after <code>status</code>, they would still arrive as a single string.</p> <p>So when a user types <code>status online</code>, the process is simple: the module identifies <code>status</code> as the command, identifies <code>online</code> as the argument string, and calls <code>do_status(self, \"online\")</code>.</p> <p>If the user types only <code>status</code> with no extra text, the module still calls the same method, but this time it passes an empty string:</p> <p><code>do_status(self, \"\")</code></p> <p>An empty string is still a string, which means your command method is always called with exactly one argument, whether the user typed extra text or not. This design keeps command handling predictable and puts you, not the framework, in control of how arguments are interpreted.</p>"},{"location":"offensive_Programming/Python_for_Cybersecurity/Python_Fundamentals/Built-in_functions_in_Python/01.The%20print%28%29function/","title":"The print () function in python","text":""},{"location":"offensive_Programming/Python_for_Cybersecurity/Python_Fundamentals/Built-in_functions_in_Python/01.The%20print%28%29function/#what-is-print-function-and-what-is-the-syntax","title":"What is print function and what is the syntax ?","text":"<p>The print() function is a function that can be used to print whatever you add inside it to the screen.

So the errors which occur because of invalid syntax are called syntax errors.</p> <p>For example: Imagine you are writing a Python script to scan a network port and inside your code you write this snippet of code:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Scanning the port 80\"\n</code></pre> <p>In this snippet of code, the Python interpreter sees that there is a ) missing and as a result the Python interpreter refuses to start and run the program completely.</p> <p>Example-1:</p> <p><pre><code>my_grade = 170\nif my_grade &lt; 80\n   print(\"You are good.\")\nelif my_grade &gt;100:\n   print you are excellent.\n</code></pre> Output: <pre><code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n</code></pre></p> <p>In this example, there are two syntax errors.

When your Python program runs into an exception during a live hack, it automatically prints this stack trace. Think of your code as a chain of dominoes falling one after another\u2014function A calls function B, which calls function C, and so on. The stack trace lists them all in order, starting from the very last function that caused the problem and working backward to where your program began.For example, if you see something like this in an error:</p> <pre><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/configs/secret_db_credentials.json'\n  File \"main.py\", line 45, in load_config\n    with open(config_path) as f:\n  File \"server.py\", line 123, in start_server\n    config = load_config()\n  File \"app.py\", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;\n    start_server()\n</code></pre> <p>This tells the hacker: \"Your secret file is at <code>/app/configs/secret_db_credentials.json</code>, the <code>load_config()</code> function is on line 45 of <code>main.py</code>, and it was called from <code>start_server()</code> on line 123 of <code>server.py</code>.\"  Suddenly they know your exact file structure, function names, and code locations\u2014information a hacker can use to attack deeper into your system.

The problem is that a programmer must never trust the intention of the user. This is one of the most important rules in programming: do not trust user input.</p> <p>The user can enter inputs that cause the program to crash, and attackers can intentionally trigger these crashes to access sensitive information. They force the program to fail by entering invalid inputs.</p> <p>Because of that, we need to validate user input correctly to avoid such issues. User input validation can be categorized into many types depending on what you want to validate and what you expect the user to enter.</p> <p>Integer validation means being completely sure that the user enters a whole number, not a float, string, or boolean value.</p> <p>In the real world, hackers often use tools to scan a network for open ports. A port is like a numbered door on a computer. These numbers are always whole numbers (integers), such as 80 or 443.</p> <p>When you write a script to scan a port, you must make sure the user provides a whole number. If the user types <code>\"ABC\"</code> instead of <code>\"80\"</code>, the program will crash.</p> <p>In Python, we use the <code>input()</code> function to get data, but it always returns text (a string). We then use <code>int()</code> to try to convert that text into a whole number.</p> <p>For Example:</p> <p>If you want to build a basic port scanner, you need to ask the user which port number they want to scan.</p> <pre><code>target_port = int(input(\"Enter the port number: \"))\n</code></pre> <p>Output:</p> <pre><code>Enter the port number:\n</code></pre> <p>The script will wait for the user input. Whatever the user enters will be stored as a string value, so we then try to convert it into an integer using the <code>int()</code> method.</p> <p>After the user enters their input, many cases can happen. In security, we call this attack surface analysis.</p> <p>Possible cases:</p> <p>Case 1: The user entered a valid port number (0\u201365535)</p> <p>If the user enters a valid value, for example <code>80</code>, the <code>input()</code> function stores it as a string <code>\"80\"</code>. Then <code>int()</code> successfully converts it into the integer <code>80</code> and stores it in the variable <code>target_port</code>.</p> <p>The program runs normally, and no errors occur.</p> <p>Case 2: The user entered a string value such as <code>\"EIGHTY\"</code></p> <p>If the user enters <code>\"EIGHTY\"</code>, the <code>input()</code> function stores it as a string. When <code>int()</code> tries to convert this value, Python cannot convert non-numeric text into an integer.</p> <p>This will cause a ValueError, and the program will crash if the input is not validated.</p> <p>Case 3: The user entered a negative value such as <code>-80</code></p> <p>If the user enters <code>-80</code>, <code>int()</code> will successfully convert it into an integer because <code>-80</code> is still a valid integer value in Python.</p> <p>However, this value is invalid in the context of port numbers, because port numbers cannot be negative. If this case is not handled, the program logic becomes incorrect even though no exception is raised.</p> <p><code>int(-80)</code> works in Python because of how the <code>int()</code> function and the integer type are defined:</p> <ol> <li> <p><code>int()</code> converts strings or numbers into Python integers. Python integers (<code>int</code>) can be negative, zero, or positive. There is no restriction on sign.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you do:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>x = int(\"-80\")\n</code></pre> <p>-Python sees the string <code>\"-80\"</code> -The <code>-</code> sign is part of the numeric literal -<code>int()</code> parses it and produces the integer <code>-80</code></p> <ol> <li>From Python\u2019s point of view, <code>-80</code> is a perfectly valid integer, so no error occurs.</li> </ol> <p>The reason this is important in your context (ports) is that just because Python allows it  doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s semantically valid. Port numbers cannot be negative in networking, so you need to check for that after converting with <code>int()</code>:</p> <pre><code>if target_port &lt; 0 or target_port &gt; 65535:\n    print(\"Invalid port number!\")\n</code></pre> <p>So, <code>int(-80)</code> works because Python\u2019s integers are signed, but <code>-80</code> is invalid for your specific use case.</p> <p>Case 4: The user entered a string with a sign such as <code>\"+80\"</code></p> <p>If the user enters <code>\"+80\"</code>, Python can successfully convert it using <code>int()</code> because <code>+80</code> is a valid integer representation.</p> <p>This means no error will occur, and the value will become <code>80</code>. Even though this input works, it should still be considered during validation because it is a user-controlled input.</p> <p>Case 5: The user entered a port number greater than the maximum allowed value</p> <p>If the user enters a number greater than the maximum port value (65535), <code>int()</code> will still convert it successfully.</p> <p>However, this value is invalid from a networking perspective, because valid port numbers must be between 0 and 65535.</p> <p>If this case is not checked, the program may behave incorrectly or attempt operations that make no sense.</p> <p>Case 6: The user entered an empty input or only spaces</p> <p>If the user presses Enter without typing anything, or enters only spaces, <code>input()</code> stores it as an empty string. Trying to convert it with <code>int()</code> will cause a ValueError, crashing the program if not handled.</p> <p>Case 7: The user entered a float value such as <code>80.5</code></p> <p>If the user enters <code>80.5</code>, <code>int()</code> cannot directly convert it unless explicitly cast or rounded. This will also cause a ValueError, and the program will crash without proper validation.</p> <p>Case 8: The user entered special characters or symbols such as <code>@80</code> or <code>#123</code></p> <p>Any non-numeric characters combined with numbers will cause <code>int()</code> to fail, raising a ValueError. Attackers can use this to test for input vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Case 9: The user entered a very large number beyond Python\u2019s integer limit (rare in Python 3 but theoretically possible if using other systems)</p> <p>Python 3 handles arbitrarily large integers, but in some applications or libraries, extremely large numbers may cause overflows or unexpected behavior. Port numbers beyond 65535 are invalid in networking terms, even if Python accepts them as integers.</p>"},{"location":"offensive_Programming/Python_for_Cybersecurity/Python_Fundamentals/User_Input_Validation/01.Type_Validation/Numeric_Types_Validation/01.%20Integer%20Validation/#types-of-integer-validation","title":"Types of Integer validation:","text":"<p>In Python programming, validating user input is essential to ensure the program runs safely and correctly.
